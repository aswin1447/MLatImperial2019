## Grading

There will be two competitions (hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)) during the course. Your task will be to participate and try as many techniques taught at the course as possible.

The outcome of your work should be a small table with results:

| Method | Parameters tuned with CV | Score | Features created on top of exiting ones |
|--------|--------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------|
| ...    | ...                      | ...   | ...                                     |
| ...    | ...                      | ...   | ...                                     |

The table should be accompanied by a small report of your workflow and reasoning. You will also need to send the code.
